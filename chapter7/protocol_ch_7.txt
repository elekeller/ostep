Schelduling:

Metric:
turnaround time: t_completion - t_arrival
    - it doesn't matter, how long the actual work takes,
        but how long it takes from the point where it
        was issued till it's finished:

    t   1   2   3   4
        J        ###X
        |       |busy|
        | turnaround |
        |            |
        |            Job finished
        |
        Job arrived/issued

ASSUMPTIONS:
1 all Jobs arrive at the same time
2 all jobs do only CPU (no I/O)
3 once a job is started, it is also finished

- FIFO: "first in, first out", also referred as "first come, first served"
    - avg turnaround time is bad because small jobs
        have to wait for long jobs

A #############X
B               ###X
C                   #####X

- SJF: "Shortest Job first"
    - avg turnaround time is better because small jobs' waiting
        time is shorter

If we relax assumption 1 SJF can perform as badly as FIFO at worst case.

Let's relax assumption 1 and 3 (jobs can arrive at different times but
they can be interrupted in mid-execution)

- STCF: "Shortest time to completion first"

    time    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
           A####    ####        ############X
           |   B###X
           |   |   |   C#######X
           |   |   |   |
           |   |   |   C (2) arrives, A has 3 left to completion
           |   |   B (1) finished
           |    B (1) arrives, A has 4 left to completion
           A (5) arrives

    - good avg turnaround time because the smallest (remaining) job
        is guaranteed to be executed and finished first at each time

New Metric:
response time: time difference from when a job arrives to when it is first executed
t_response = t_first_run - t_arrival

0   1   2
A####
B    ####
C        ####
|   |   |C:2
|   |B:1
|A:0

- RR: "Round Robin", also referred to as "time slicing"
    - each job is run for a  time slice (scheduling quantum) and then the scheduler
        switches to the next job in the run queue
    - response time is faster than for STCF/SJF/FIFO
    - avg turnaround time is bad because all jobs have to wait for each other and the more
        jobs there are in the queue, the longer it takes till it's one's job's turn again
