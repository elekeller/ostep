Address spaces

Memory if there was only one program/thread:

#  Program code #
#  | HEAP       # grows during allocations
#  V            #
#               #
#  free space   #
#               #
#          ^    #
#    STACK |    # grows during proceduce calls/...

Problem: Users want many threads at the same time and there's no simple
way to predict how much Memory they will need.

Solution: Virtualize Memory. Let the program think it's at Address 0 while
in reality it's somewhere else.

You can print out the address of a pointer or the program itself but every
address that you can print is virtual, you wil never be able to see the
real/physical address of anything.
